Minecraft: Game licensed by Mojang AB

N-API: N-API's source code, class files, etc. as obtained from the Minecraft Forum topic by Puredarkness, the 
alter ego if you will of Niadel.

User:
The user of N-API or Minecraft, anyone who writes mods for Minecraft using N-API.

The Creator:
Niadel, N-API's (head) developer.


Usage Rights:
-----------------------------------------------------------
You may install this Modification Development Interface into a paid Minecraft premium account without 
restriction.

If you are a modder using N-API, you may extend, implement, or instantiate an object of any class provided
by N-API.


Modification Rights:
-----------------------------------------------------------
You may modify it, but any released versions HAVE to be CLEARLY marked as it being modified, front page and
everything. The modid must also be different.


Distribution Rights:
-----------------------------------------------------------
If you distribute it, it MUST be free of charge - This includes things like adf.ly - As adf.ly or associate
advertising sites is not used in the main N-API install or the source, I therefore do not allow use of 
that site or sites like it in redistributions, and discourage it's use in mods. If files other than N-API 
files are present in the installation, this license does not cover this and The Creator HIGHLY discourages 
redistributing those prior to reading those pieces of software's license.
