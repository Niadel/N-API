N-API
=====

Modification Development Interface to add features to Minecraft without editing base files, like Forge, only simpler(?).

N-API is only in Alpha and may change. By the way, the N stands for 'Not' as it's NOT an API.

FOR MODDERS:

At time of writing, N-API is still a WIP. Mods using N-API may change (package names change, Minecraft changes force me to remove certain features) and
may still break after N-API is fully released.
