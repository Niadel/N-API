FOR MODDERS:

At time of writing, N-API is still a WIP. Mods using N-API may change (package names change, Minecraft changes force me to remove certain features) and
may still break after N-API is fully released.

Legitimate Distributors:
	https://github.com/Niadel/N-API - source code.
	There are no binary distributions at this point in time.
