Distribution Rights:
	Only The Author and Mojang can distribute N-API or give others the right to distribute/redistribute it. This applies to modified copies of N-API as well. 
	However, you can use this in your modpacks if you so choose, only if the distribution is unmodified. If you want to use a modified version of N-API in your
	modpack, contact The Author and give The Author details of the modified N-API version. You can find the legitimate locations/distributors in the README.txt
	file or, better yet, at https://github.com/Niadel/N-API as that will be updated much more often than the README.txt. 

Usage Rights:
	You may use N-API freely, even distribute it, as long as you don't sell a copy of it, modified or otherwise. This includes,
	but freedom of use is not limited to: extending or implementing any of the classes/interfaces, calling any class's methods,
	using any of the enums, marking  anything with an annotation, etc. You may also use any mods with N-API, as long as they
	are compatible with N-API, Forge, and/or other mods and don't edit any of The Game's classes, unless it is merely via a
	bytecode manipulation library like ASM at runtime.

IMPORTANT:
    N-API is provided as it is when you download it, with no warranty AT ALL whatsoever, whether it may be express or implied. The Author
    can not be held responsible for any claim, damages to your system or any unmentioned liability due to the use of or in connection of
    N-API or any of it's mods. If issues come from the use of an N-API mod, direct the blame towards them.
